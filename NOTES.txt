Question Search Implementation
==============================

Approach: Hybrid semantic + fuzzy search

Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (via transformers.js) - can upgrade to bge-large-en-v1.5
- Runs in Electron main process (onnxruntime-node@1.14.0)
- Renderer communicates via IPC
- Local model files in /models folder

Working setup:
- onnxruntime-node@1.14.0 (newer versions broken)
- @xenova/transformers@2.17.2
- Model files downloaded manually to avoid CSP issues

How it works:
1. App startup: load model in main process, generate embeddings for all questions
2. On search: embed query via IPC -> cosine similarity -> combine with Fuse.js
3. Score = 70% semantic + 30% fuzzy
4. Display best match with percentage

To switch to bge-large-en-v1.5:
1. Download model files to models/bge-large-en-v1.5/
2. Update model name in src/main/embeddings.ts
