Question Search Implementation
==============================

Approach: Hybrid semantic + fuzzy search

Model: bge-large-en-v1.5 (via transformers.js)
- ~335MB, runs locally in Electron
- State-of-the-art for semantic retrieval
- Target latency: <1000ms

How it works:
1. Pre-compute embeddings for all questions (store in app)
2. On search: embed query -> cosine similarity -> top matches
3. Fuse.js as secondary boost for character-level/typo matching

Route: /search
- Empty state: nothing rendered
- On submit: fuzzy + semantic search, show closest match
